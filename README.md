Step-By-Step Setup of a Helium Data-Only Hotspot that follows the guides available under
https://docs.helium.com/mine-hnt/data-only-guides/rak-concentrators/
We strictly stick to the list of Lora Concentrator listed there. I got a hold of RAK2245 but any other listed Concentrator should be fine too. The later software setup using the preconfigured Raspberry image let's you select the concentrator type. In principle it should be possible to reconfigure your data-only hotspot when you change to another concentrator as long as it is listed under the RAK

## Hardware Parts

Be mindful of the correct frequency for your region, you will likely encounter that most active Lora components for the common regions are SOLD OUT.
