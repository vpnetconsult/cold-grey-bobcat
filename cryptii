Occasionally you need to decrypt the lora data payload from binary/base64 to hex. 

The ttn-gateway log would show the sensor "txpk" message (sample below, formatted for better visibility). The data payload containing the sensor data (like temperature, location etc.) is a base64 encoded string.
To decode (and use in console test message), I copied the string into cryptii and decode into hex. Then the hex string I copy into the function script validator "Payload input" message.


{"txpk":
	{
		"imme":false,
		"tmst":3775150828,
		"freq":923.2000122070312,
		"rfch":0,
		"powe":27,
		"modu":"LORA",
		"datr":"SF10BW125",
		"codr":"4/5",
		"ipol":true,
		"prea":null,
		"size":33,
		"data":"IHSX5IUXcj2jW5/COWhgSoil3Ax3vKcO3yJHmx091yv+"
	}
}
